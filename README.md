## 📋 Project Description

This project creates a digital version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy, allowing users to draw pixelated designs by moving their mouse over a grid of squares. The application demonstrates DOM manipulation skills and responsive design principles using Flexbox.

## 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Event listeners (mouseover, click)
- Flexbox layout system
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- User input validation
- Dynamic content generation

## 📋 Project Requirements

The Odin Project assignment required implementing the following features:

### Core Requirements
1. **16x16 Grid Creation**: Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript (not hardcoded HTML)
2. **Flexbox Layout**: Use CSS Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (not CSS Grid)
3. **Hover Drawing Effect**: Set up a hover effect so grid divs change color when mouse passes over them
4. **Dynamic Grid Resizing**: Add a button that prompts user for grid size and regenerates the grid
5. **Input Validation**: Limit user input to maximum of 100 squares to prevent performance issues
6. **Consistent Grid Size**: New grids should maintain the same total pixel size regardless of resolution

### Extra Credit Challenges
- **Random RGB Colors**: Randomize squares' RGB values with each interaction
- **Progressive Darkening**: Each interaction darkens the square by 10% until fully black (10 interactions)

## 🌟 Extra Features Implemented

Beyond the core requirements, I added several enhancements:

- **Clear Button**: Added a dedicated clear button for easy canvas reset (not required by assignment)
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Used CSS variables for dynamic grid sizing (modern approach)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation for edge cases and invalid inputs
